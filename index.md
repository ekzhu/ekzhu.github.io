I am a Senior Researcher at 
[Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ekzhu/),
focusing on data science tools and platforms.

I did my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Toronto, 
under the supervision of
[Prof. Ren√©e J. Miller](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~miller).
My [thesis]({% link papers/Zhu_Erkang_201906_PhD_thesis.pdf %}) is in 
data discovery for massive data lakes
such as [Open Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data), 
large-scale 
[similarity search](https://github.com/ekzhu/SetSimilaritySearch), 
and randomized algorithms 
([data sketches](https://github.com/ekzhu/datasketch)).

I continue to contribute exploratory work in data science and data management.
Feel free to send me an email about my 
[open source projects](https://github.com/ekzhu).
